# Spencer
The MTG Speculation Bot

## What is it?
Back in the day I used to play a lot of Magic: The Gathering and a large portion
of the MTG community takes part in an activity called speculation where they
attempt to ascertain the $$ value of a new card before it's printed. I've
decided that this would be an excellent first machine learning project, and
thus Spencer was born.
